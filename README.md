# 👋 Hey, I'm Sangyan Dayal

I'm a 3rd-year **Computer Science & Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Technology, Patna** with a strong drive for coding and building impactful software. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean, efficient, and practical development.

From crafting full-stack applications to exploring Machine Learning, I'm always eager to dive deep, learn fast, and create solutions that work. I thrive on solving real problems, whether it means starting from scratch or improving what already exists.

Curious by nature and driven by growth, I'm constantly looking for opportunities that challenge my thinking and sharpen my skills.
